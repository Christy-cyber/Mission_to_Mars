# Mission to Mars
## Purpose
Several websites were scraped in order to produce a webpage with the latest articles and images about the planet Mars. The final webpage, which is mobile responsive, includes a 'button' that, when clicked, scrapes the following websites for the latest articles and images about the red planet and automatically updates the webpage. Mars hemispheres are also shown.  This project highlights the use of MongoDB and Flask.

## Resources
The following websites were scraped for articles and images:
  - https://mars.nasa.gov/news/
  - https://spaceimages-mars.com/
  - https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/
  - https://marshemispheres.com/
